# Guidelines for contributors

Please use these guidelines when creating DevOps docs for general publication.

* Use Markdown.

* Use the command line interface, scripts, or APIs.

* Avoid using UI unless absolutely necessary.

* Avoid screenshots unless it's the best/only way to convey needed info.

* If you include images, also give us the image source files, so we can update the images, if needed.

* Always tell folks what they're going to do before we tell them how to do it.

* Be direct and friendly.

# Ping Identity DevOps Registration

Registering for the Ping Identity DevOps program grants you credentials that can be provided as variables to our containers. This streamlines license issues by allowing the container to automatically retrieve an evaluation license upon container startup. 

> Evaluation licenses are short-lived and *not* intended for use in production deployments.

Follow these steps to obtain your DevOps user and key:

1. [Create a Ping Identity account, or sign on to your existing account](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/account/sign-on.html).
2. You'll need a DevOps user name and DevOps key.
   * PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER - The email address associated with your Ping Identity account.
   * PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY - Request your DevOps key using this [form - https://bit.ly/ping-devops-request](https://bit.ly/ping-devops-request).

    Your DevOps user name and key will be sent to your email. This will generally take only a few business hours.

> For ease of use, we recommend you use the DevOps user and key approach when evaluating our container use-cases. However, if you'd rather use an existing Ping Identity product license, see [Use an existing license](existingLicense.md) for instructions before proceeding.
